Llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas (Lama
 pacos) are members of the Camelid family,
 which also includes the vicuna (Lama vicunga)
 and guanaco (Lama guanicoe).  Their inclusion
 in this family is based upon their characteristic
 traits of being hornless, cud-chewing ruminants
 with an even number of toes and padded feet.
 Their gentle disposition, need for minimal care,
 and ability to adapt to a variety of climates
 makes them an easy species for which to care.
 Llamas and alpacas may be collectively referred
 to as â€œlamas.
